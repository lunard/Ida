There will always be adventure waiting in nature and hiking is the perfect way to find it. Going for hikes connects us with our roots, we become intimate with earth and learn how to ‘tune in’ to her frequency. All our senses are awakened when we spend time in Nature.
Hydrate properly. Every terrain and body is different but as a general rule of thumb you should stick to carrying about 1 litre of water for every two hours you will be hiking.
Although the hiking doesn’t require much gear other than shoes we still believe that having some essentials will help you during your journey and possibly help keep you safe if any mishaps were to occur.
