# Ida Interactive Destination Assistant
**NOI Hackathon Summer Edition Project**

## What is Ida?
Ida has two meanings. The first is literal, it stands for: **Interactive Destination Assistant** the other one is more fun: its a German name 💁‍♂️ and that helps to give personality to the assistant.

Ida is basically an assistant that helps turists to plan excursions in [South Tyrol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Tyrol).

## How does Ida assist turists?
First things first:

Ida is composed of more than one part. The first one beeing: Ida runs on a [Kiosk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_kiosk). The second one: Ida also runs on a mobile device.

### Idas Workflow
* The turist stands in front of the Kiosk and selects his language🌐.
* The turist can take a picture using the Kiosk. A [cognitive service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_computing) recognizes: age, sex, number of persons and the group type such as: single, couple, family or friends. (this step can be skipped, and information can be corrected / inserted manually.)
* Ida will start to ask some questions to the turist. Examples:

What do you prefer?

* **Historical cities**
    * **Famed Landmarks**
    * **Local Eats**

* **Beautiful landscapes**
    * **Supreme relaxation**
    * **A hike in the mountains**

.....

* According to the obtained Information Ida will generate a couple of **unique experiences** in South Tyrol.
* The turist selects the experience and enjois the day👌.
* Optionally the turist can download the app📱 that adds more information to the experience and provides wheather☁️ related updates... The user can also print his selected unique experience.

## Where will Ida be placed?
Good question🤔

💡 Ida can be placed in Hotels. Moreover Hotels can offer there own experiences on Ida, next to the public ones everyone can create, of course.

💡 Technically at any other place of interest.

* The hotels
* The community
* Travelguides: this group of people can offer **paid excursions**.
